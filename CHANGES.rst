Change log
==========

Version 1.0.2 [2022-12-05]
--------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Made private storage backend configurable
- Updated API views to use  ``filterset_class`` instead of ``filter_class``
  (required by ``django-filter==22.1``)
- Fixed organization cache bug in SAML ACS view: A forceful update of
  the user's organization cache is done before performing post-login
  operations to avoid issues occurring due to outdated cache.
- Added missing Furlan translation for sesame link validity
- Use storage backend method for deleting ``RadiusBatch.csvfile``:
  The previous implementation used the "os" module for deleting resisdual
  csv files. This causes issues when the project uses a file storage backend
  other than based on file system.
- Added error handling in RadiusBatch admin change view: Accessing admin change
  view of a non-existent RadiusBatch object resulted in Server Error 500
  because the ``DoesNotExist`` conditioned was not handled.
- Load image using ``static()`` in RegisteredUserInline.get_is_verified
- Use ``path`` URL kwarg in "serve_private_file" URL pattern
- Honor DISPOSABLE_RADIUS_USER_TOKEN in accounting stop API view:
  The accounting stop REST API operation was not taking into
  account the OPENWISP_RADIUS_DISPOSABLE_RADIUS_USER_TOKEN
  setting when disabling the auth capability of the radius token.

Version 1.0.1 [2022-05-10]
--------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug in the organization radius settings form which was causing it
  to not display some default values correctly
- Fixed a bug in allowed mobile prefix implementation:
  the implementation was joining the globally allowed prefixes
  and the prefixes allowed at org level, with the result
  that disabling a prefix at org level was not possible
- Called-station-ID command: log with warning instead of ``warn`` or ``error``:
  - warn > warning (warn is deprecated)
  - use warning instead of errors for more temporary connection issues cases

Changes
~~~~~~~

Backward incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Updated prefixes of REST API URLs:

  - API endpoints dedicated to FreeRADIUS have moved to ``/api/v1/freeradius/``
  - the rest of the API endpoints have moved to ``/api/v1/radius/``

- Allowed ``username`` and ``phone_number`` in password reset API,
  the endpoint now accepts the "input" parameter instead of "email"
- Removed customizations for checks and password hashing because
  they are unmaintained, any user needing these customizations is
  advised to implement them as a third party app
- Improved REST API to change password:
  inherited ``PasswordChangeView`` of openwisp-users to add support for
  the current-password field in password change view

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added support for Django 3.2 and 4.0
- Dropped support for Django 2.2
- Upgraded celery to 5.2.x
- Updated and tested Django REST Framework to 3.13.0
- Added support for Python 3.8, 3.9

  `SMS token settings <https://openwisp-radius.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/settings.html#sms-token-related-settings>`_
- Switched to new navigation menu and new OpenWISP theme
- Allowed users to sign up to multiple organizations
- Update username when phone number is changed if username is equal to the phone number
- Update stop time and termination to ``None`` if ``status_type`` is ``Interim-Update``
- Send password reset emails using HTML theme:
  leverage the new `openwisp-utils send_email function
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-utils#openwisp-utils-admin-theme-email-send-email>`_
  to send an HTML version
  of the reset password email based on the configurable email HTML theme of OpenWISP

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

  an user trying to authorize using the authorization data of an
  org for which they are not member of must be rejected
- Fixed radius user group creation with multiple orgs
- Added validation of phone number uniqueness in the registration API
- Fixed issues with translatable strings:

  - we don't translate log lines anymore because these won't be shown
    to end users

    therefore the use of ``str.format()`` has been restored
  - improved some user facing strings

- Fixed Accounting-On and Accounting-Of accounting requests with blank usernames

- Fixed handling of interim-updates for closed sessions:
  added handling of "Interim-Updates" for RadiusAccounting sessions
  that are closed by OpenWISP when user logs into another organization
- Flag user as verified in batch user creation
- Added validation which prevents the creation of duplicated
  check/reply attributes

  and ``email`` to response data
