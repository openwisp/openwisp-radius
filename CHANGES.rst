Changes
~~~~~~~

Backward incompatible changes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Renamed ``delete_old_users`` command to
  ``delete_old_radiusbatch_users``.
- The `OPENWISP_RADIUS_BATCH_DELETE_EXPIRED
  <https://openwisp.io/docs/stable/radius/user/settings.html#openwisp-radius-batch-delete-expired>`_
  setting now expects days instead of months.

Deprecation warnings
++++++++++++++++++++

- Using the ``default`` key in ``OPENWISP_RADIUS_PASSWORD_RESET_URLS`` is
  deprecated. Use ``__all__`` instead.
- Using organization slugs for key in
  ``OPENWISP_RADIUS_CALLED_STATION_IDS`` are deprecated. Use organization
  IDs instead.
- In ``delete_old_radiusbatch_users`` management command, the
  ``--older-than-months`` option is deprecated. Use ``--older-than-days``
  instead.

Dependencies
++++++++++++

- Bumped ``weasyprint~=59.0``.
- Bumped ``pydyf~=0.10.0``.
- Bumped ``dj-rest-auth~=6.0.0``.
- Bumped ``openwisp-utils[rest,celery]~=1.1.1``.

- Dropped support for Django ``3.0.x`` and ``3.1.x``.

Other changes
+++++++++++++

- The ``cleanup_stale_radacct`` management command now uses the session's
  ``update_time`` to determine staleness, falling back to ``start_time``
  if ``update_time`` is unavailable.
- Stopped sending login email notifications when accounting framed
  protocol is ``PPP``.
- Send login emails only to users with verified email addresses.
- Grouped SMS features in the organization admin.
- Allowed counter's check method to return ``None`` to prevent adding a
  reply to the response.
- The email received from the IdP in SAML registration will be flagged as
  verified.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed validation for organization's password reset URLs.
- Fixed saving ``RadiusCheck`` / ``RadiusReply`` objects without an
  organization returning a 500 HTTP response.
- Fixed handling of accounting stop requests with empty octets.
- Prevented user registration with landline numbers.
- Ignored `IntegrityError` on duplicate accounting start requests.
- Removed default values from fallback fields.
- User need to have required model permissions to perform admin actions.

Version 1.0.2 [2022-12-05]
--------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Made private storage backend configurable
- Updated API views to use ``filterset_class`` instead of ``filter_class``
  (required by ``django-filter==22.1``)
- Fixed organization cache bug in SAML ACS view: A forceful update of the
  user's organization cache is done before performing post-login
  operations to avoid issues occurring due to outdated cache.
- Added missing Furlan translation for sesame link validity
- Use storage backend method for deleting ``RadiusBatch.csvfile``: The
  previous implementation used the "os" module for deleting resisdual csv
  files. This causes issues when the project uses a file storage backend
  other than based on file system.
- Added error handling in RadiusBatch admin change view: Accessing admin
  change view of a non-existent RadiusBatch object resulted in Server
  Error 500 because the ``DoesNotExist`` conditioned was not handled.
- Load image using ``static()`` in RegisteredUserInline.get_is_verified
- Use ``path`` URL kwarg in "serve_private_file" URL pattern
- Honor DISPOSABLE_RADIUS_USER_TOKEN in accounting stop API view: The
  accounting stop REST API operation was not taking into account the
  OPENWISP_RADIUS_DISPOSABLE_RADIUS_USER_TOKEN setting when disabling the
  auth capability of the radius token.

Version 1.0.1 [2022-05-10]
--------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug in the organization radius settings form which was causing
  it to not display some default values correctly
- Fixed a bug in allowed mobile prefix implementation: the implementation
  was joining the globally allowed prefixes and the prefixes allowed at
  org level, with the result that disabling a prefix at org level was not
  possible
- Called-station-ID command: log with warning instead of ``warn`` or
  ``error``: - warn > warning (warn is deprecated) - use warning instead
  of errors for more temporary connection issues cases
