Ensure test coverage does not decrease
--------------------------------------

First of all, install the test requirements:

.. code-block:: shell

    workon radius  # activate virtualenv
    pip install --no-cache-dir -U -r requirements-test.txt

When you introduce changes, ensure test coverage is not decreased with:

.. code-block:: shell

    coverage run --source=openwisp_radius runtests.py

Follow style conventions

First of all, install the test requirements:

.. code-block:: shell

    npm install -g jslint

Before committing your work check that your changes are not breaking
our `coding style conventions <https://openwisp.io/docs/developer/contributing.html#coding-style-conventions>`_:

.. code-block:: shell

    # reformat the code according to the conventions
    openwisp-qa-format
