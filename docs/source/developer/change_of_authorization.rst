Change of Authorization (CoA)
=============================

.. important::

    The *Change of Authorization (CoA)* is disabled by default.

    In order to enable this feature you have it enable it via
    :ref:`global setting or from the admin interface
    <coa_enabled_setting>`.

The openwisp-radius module supports the Change of Authorization (CoA)
specification of the RADIUS protocol described in
`RFC 5176 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5176/>`_.

Whenever the *RADIUS Group* of a user is changed, openwisp-radius
updates the NAS with the user's latest RADIUS Attributes. This is achieved
by sending CoA RADIUS packet to NAS for all open RADIUS sessions of
the user. This allows enforcing RADIUS limits without requiring
the user to re-authenticate with the NAS.

The CoA RADIUS packet contains the RADIUS Attributes defined in the
new *RADIUS Group* of the user. If the new *RADIUS Group* does
not specify any attributes, the CoA RADIUS packet will unset the
attributes set by the previous *RADIUS Group*.

Consider the following example with two *RADIUS Groups*:

+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **RADIUS Group Name** | **RADIUS Group Checks**                              |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **users**             | +-------------------------------+------------------+ |
|                       | | **Attribute**                 | **Value**        | |
|                       | +-------------------------------+------------------+ |
|                       | | ``Max-Daily-Session-Traffic`` | ``:=3000000000`` | |
|                       | +-------------------------------+------------------+ |
|                       | | ``Max-Daily-Session``         | ``:=10800``      | |
|                       | +-------------------------------+------------------+ |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **power-users**       | *Note: This group intentionally does not define any  |
|                       | limits.*                                             |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+

A user, Jane is assigned ``users`` *RADIUS Group* and is currently using the
network, i.e. has an open RADIUS session. The administrator of the system
decided to upgrade the *RADIUS Group* of Jane to ``power-users``, allowing
Jane to use the network without any limits. Without CoA, Jane will have to
logout of the captive portal (NAS) and log-in again to browse the network
without any limits. But when CoA is enabled in openwisp-radius, openwisp-radius
will update the NAS with the limits defined in Jane's new RADIUS Group. In this
case, openwisp-radius will tell the NAS to unset the limits that were configured
by the previous RADIUS Group.

If the system administrators later decided to downgrade the *RADIUS Group*
of Jane to ``users``, hence enforcing limits to the usage of the network,
openwisp-radius will update the NAS with the limits defined for the ``users``
group for all active RADIUS sessions if CoA is enabled in openwisp-radius.
