Freeradius Setup for Captive Portal authentication
==================================================

This guide explains how to install and configure `freeradius 3
<https://freeradius.org>`_ in order to make it work with OpenWISP RADIUS
for Captive Portal authentication.

The guide is written for debian based systems, other linux distributions
can work as well but the name of packages and files may be different.

Widely used solutions used with OpenWISP RADIUS are PfSense and
Coova-Chilli, but other solutions can be used as well.

.. note::

    Before users can authenticate through a captive portal, they will most
    likely need to sign up through a web page, or alternatively, they will
    need to perform social login or some other kind of Single Sign On
    (SSO).

    The :doc:`OpenWISP WiFi Login Pages </wifi-login-pages/index>` web app
    is an open source solution which integrates with OpenWISP RADIUS to
    provide features like self user registration, social login, SSO/SAML
    login, SMS verification, simple username & password login using the
    :ref:`radius_user_token` method.

    For more information see: :doc:`OpenWISP WiFi Login Pages
    </wifi-login-pages/index>`

How to install freeradius 3
---------------------------

First of all, become root:

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo -s

In order to **install a recent version of FreeRADIUS**, we recommend using
the `freeradius packages provided by NetworkRADIUS
<https://networkradius.com/packages/>`_.

After having updated the APT sources list to pull the NetworkRADIUS
packages, let's proceed to update the list of available packages:

.. code-block:: shell

    apt update

These packages are always needed:

.. code-block:: shell

    apt install freeradius freeradius-rest

If you use MySQL:

.. code-block:: shell

    apt install freeradius-mysql

If you use PostgreSQL:

.. code-block:: shell

    apt install freeradius-postgresql

.. warning::

    You have to install and configure an SQL database like PostgreSQL,
    MySQL (SQLite can also work, but we won't treat it here) and make sure
    both OpenWISP RADIUS and Freeradius point to it.

    The steps outlined above may not be sufficient to get the DB of your
    choice to run, please consult the documentation of your database of
    choice for more information on how to get it to run properly.

    In the rest of this document we will mention PostgreSQL often because
    that is the database generally preferred by the Django community.

Configuring Freeradius 3
------------------------

For a complete reference on how to configure freeradius please read the
`Freeradius wiki, configuration files
<https://wiki.freeradius.org/config/Configuration-files>`_ and their
`configuration tutorial <https://wiki.freeradius.org/guide/HOWTO>`_.

.. note::

    The path to freeradius configuration could be different on your
    system. This article use the ``/etc/freeradius/`` directory that ships
    with recent debian distributions and its derivatives

Refer to the `mods-available documentation
<https://networkradius.com/doc/3.0.10/raddb/mods-available/home.html>`_
for the available configuration values.

Enable the configured modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all enable the ``rest`` and optionally the ``sql`` module:

.. code-block:: shell

    ln -s /etc/freeradius/mods-available/rest /etc/freeradius/mods-enabled/rest
    # optional
    ln -s /etc/freeradius/mods-available/sql /etc/freeradius/mods-enabled/sql

.. _radius_configure_rest_module:

Configure the REST module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure the rest module by editing the file
``/etc/freeradius/mods-enabled/rest``, substituting ``<url>`` with your
django project's URL, (for example, if you are testing a development
environment, the URL could be ``http://127.0.0.1:8000``, otherwise in
production could be something like ``https://openwisp2.mydomain.org``)-

.. warning::

    Remember you need to add your freeradius server IP address in
    `openwisp freeradius allowed hosts settings
    <../user/settings.html#openwisp-radius-freeradius-allowed-hosts>`_. If
    the freeradius server IP is not in allowed hosts, all requests to
    openwisp radius API will return ``403``.

Refer to the `rest module documentation
<https://networkradius.com/doc/3.0.10/raddb/mods-available/rest.html>`_
for the available configuration values.

.. code-block:: ini

    # /etc/freeradius/mods-enabled/rest

    connect_uri = "<url>"

    authorize {
        uri = "${..connect_uri}/api/v1/freeradius/authorize/"
        method = 'post'
        body = 'json'
        data = '{"username": "%{User-Name}", "password": "%{User-Password}"}'
        tls = ${..tls}
    }

    # this section can be left empty
    authenticate {}

    post-auth {
        uri = "${..connect_uri}/api/v1/freeradius/postauth/"
        method = 'post'
        body = 'json'
        data = '{"username": "%{User-Name}", "password": "%{User-Password}", "reply": "%{reply:Packet-Type}", "called_station_id": "%{Called-Station-ID}", "calling_station_id": "%{Calling-Station-ID}"}'
        tls = ${..tls}
    }

    accounting {
        uri = "${..connect_uri}/api/v1/freeradius/accounting/"
        method = 'post'
        body = 'json'
        data = '{"status_type": "%{Acct-Status-Type}", "session_id": "%{Acct-Session-Id}", "unique_id": "%{Acct-Unique-Session-Id}", "username": "%{User-Name}", "realm": "%{Realm}", "nas_ip_address": "%{NAS-IP-Address}", "nas_port_id": "%{NAS-Port}", "nas_port_type": "%{NAS-Port-Type}", "session_time": "%{Acct-Session-Time}", "authentication": "%{Acct-Authentic}", "input_octets": "%{Acct-Input-Octets}", "output_octets": "%{Acct-Output-Octets}", "called_station_id": "%{Called-Station-Id}", "calling_station_id": "%{Calling-Station-Id}", "terminate_cause": "%{Acct-Terminate-Cause}", "service_type": "%{Service-Type}", "framed_protocol": "%{Framed-Protocol}", "framed_ip_address": "%{Framed-IP-Address}"}'
        tls = ${..tls}
    }

Configure the SQL module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    The ``sql`` module is not extremely needed but we treat it here since
    it can be useful to implement custom behavior, moreover we treat it in
    this document also to show that OpenWISP RADIUS can integrate itself
    with other widely used FreeRADIUS modules.

Once you have configured properly an SQL server, e.g. PostgreSQL:, and you
can connect with a username and password edit the file
``/etc/freeradius/mods-available/sql`` to configure Freeradius to use the
relational database.

Change the configuration for ``driver``, ``dialect``, ``server``,
``port``, ``login``, ``password``, ``radius_db`` as you need to fit your
SQL server configuration.

Refer to the `sql module documentation
<https://networkradius.com/doc/3.0.10/raddb/mods-available/sql.html>`_ for
the available configuration values.

Example configuration using the PostgreSQL database:

.. code-block:: ini

    # /etc/freeradius/mods-available/sql

    driver = "rlm_sql_postgresql"
    dialect = "postgresql"

    # Connection info:
    server = "localhost"
    port = 5432
    login = "<user>"
    password = "<password>"
    radius_db = "radius"

.. _radius_freeradius_site:

Configure the site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section explains how to configure the FreeRADIUS site.

Please refer to :ref:`radius_freeradius_api_authentication` to understand
the different possibilities with which FreeRADIUS can authenticate
requests going to OpenWISP RADIUS so that OpenWISP RADIUS knows to which
organization each request belongs.

If you are **not** using the method described in :ref:`radius_user_token`,
you have to do the following:

- create one FreeRADIUS site for each organization
- uncomment the line which starts with ``# api_token_header``
- substitute the occurrences of ``<org_uuid>`` and
  ``<org_radius_api_token>`` with the UUID & RADIUS API token of each
  organization, refer to the section :ref:`radius_organization_uuid_token`
  for finding these values.

If you are deploying a captive portal setup and can use the RADIUS User
Token method, you can get away with having only one freeradius site for
all the organizations and can simply copy the configuration shown below.

.. code-block:: ini

    # /etc/freeradius/sites-enabled/default
    # Remove `#` symbol from the line to uncomment it

    server default {
        # if you are not using Radius Token authentication method, please uncomment
        # and set the values for <org_uuid> & <org_radius_api_token>
        # api_token_header = "Authorization: Bearer <org_uuid> <org_radius_api_token>"

        authorize {
            # if you are not using Radius Token authentication method, please uncomment the following
            # update control { &REST-HTTP-Header += "${...api_token_header}" }
            rest
        }

        # this section can be left empty
        authenticate {}

        post-auth {
            # if you are not using Radius Token authentication method, please uncomment the following
            # update control { &REST-HTTP-Header += "${...api_token_header}" }
            rest

            Post-Auth-Type REJECT {
                # if you are not using Radius Token authentication method, please uncomment the following
                # update control { &REST-HTTP-Header += "${....api_token_header}" }
                rest
            }
        }

        accounting {
            # if you are not using Radius Token authentication method, please uncomment the following
            # update control { &REST-HTTP-Header += "${...api_token_header}" }
            rest
        }
    }

Please also ensure that ``acct_unique`` is present in the
``pre-accounting`` section:

.. code-block:: ini

    preacct {
        # ...
        acct_unique
        # ...
    }

.. _radius_restart_freeradius:

Restart freeradius to make the configuration effective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Restart freeradius to load the new configuration:

.. code-block:: shell

    service freeradius restart
    # alternatively if you are using systemd
    systemctl restart freeradius

In case of errors you can run `freeradius in debug mode
<https://wiki.freeradius.org/guide/radiusd-X>`_ by running ``freeradius
-X`` in order to find out the reason of the failure.

**A common problem, especially during development and testing, is that the
openwisp-radius application may not be running**, in that case you can
find out how to run the django development server in the
:doc:`../developer/installation` section.

Also make sure that this server runs on the port specified in
``/etc/freeradius/mods-enabled/rest``.

You may also want to take a look at the `Freeradius documentation
<https://freeradius.org/documentation/>`_ for further information that is
freeradius specific.

Reconfigure the development environment using PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll have to reconfigure the development environment as well before
being able to use openwisp-radius for managing the freeradius databases.

If you have installed for development, create a file
``tests/local_settings.py`` and add the following code to configure the
database:

.. code-block:: python

    # openwisp-radius/tests/local_settings.py
    DATABASES = {
        "default": {
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2",
            "NAME": "<db_name>",
            "USER": "<db_user>",
            "PASSWORD": "<db_password>",
            "HOST": "127.0.0.1",
            "PORT": "5432",
        },
    }

Make sure the database by the name ``<db_name>`` is created and also the
role ``<db_user>`` with ``<db_password>`` as password.

Using Radius Checks for Authorization Information
-------------------------------------------------

Traditionally, when using an SQL backend with Freeradius, user
authorization information such as User-Name and `"known good"
<https://freeradius.org/radiusd/man/rlm_pap.html>`_ password can be stored
using the *radcheck* table provided by Freeradius' default SQL schema.

OpenWISP RADIUS instead uses the FreeRADIUS `rlm_rest
<https://networkradius.com/doc/current/raddb/mods-available/rest.html>`_
module in order to take advantage of the built in user management and
authentication capabilities of Django (for more information about these
topics see :ref:`radius_configure_rest_module` and `User authentication in
Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/>`_).

When migrating from existing FreeRADIUS deployments or in cases where it
is preferred to use the FreeRADIUS *radcheck* table for storing user
credentials it is possible to utilize `rlm_sql
<https://wiki.freeradius.org/modules/Rlm_sql>`_ in parallel with (or
instead of) `rlm_rest
<https://networkradius.com/doc/current/raddb/mods-available/rest.html>`_
for authorization.

.. note::

    Bypassing the REST API of openwisp-radius means that you will have to
    manually create the radius check entries for each user you want to
    authenticate with FreeRADIUS.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure support for accessing user credentials with Radius Checks
ensure the ``authorize`` section of your site as follows contains the
``sql`` module:

.. code-block:: ini

    # /etc/freeradius/sites-available/default

    authorize {
        # ...
        sql  # <-- the sql module
        # ...
    }

.. _radius_debugging:

Debugging & Troubleshooting
---------------------------

In this section we will explain how to debug your freeradius instance.

Start freeradius in debug mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When debugging we suggest you to open up a dedicated terminal window to
run freeradius in debug mode:

.. code-block:: shell

    # we need to stop the main freeradius process first
    service freeradius stop
    # alternatively if you are using systemd
    systemctl stop freeradius
    # launch freeradius in debug mode
    freeradius -X

Testing authentication and authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can do this with ``radtest``:

.. code-block:: shell

    # radtest <username> <password> <host> 10 <secret>
    radtest admin admin localhost 10 testing123

A successful authentication will return similar output:

.. code-block:: text

    Sent Access-Request Id 215 from 0.0.0.0:34869 to 127.0.0.1:1812 length 75
        User-Name = "admin"
        User-Password = "admin"
        NAS-IP-Address = 127.0.0.1
        NAS-Port = 10
        Message-Authenticator = 0x00
        Cleartext-Password = "admin"
    Received Access-Accept Id 215 from 127.0.0.1:1812 to 0.0.0.0:0 length 20

While an unsuccessful one will look like the following:

.. code-block:: text

    Sent Access-Request Id 85 from 0.0.0.0:51665 to 127.0.0.1:1812 length 73
        User-Name = "foo"
        User-Password = "bar"
        NAS-IP-Address = 127.0.0.1
        NAS-Port = 10
        Message-Authenticator = 0x00
        Cleartext-Password = "bar"
    Received Access-Reject Id 85 from 127.0.0.1:1812 to 0.0.0.0:0 length 20
    (0) -: Expected Access-Accept got Access-Reject

Alternatively, you can use ``radclient`` which allows more complex tests;
in the following example we show how to test an authentication request
which includes ``Called-Station-ID`` and ``Calling-Station-ID``:

.. code-block:: shell

    user="foo"
    pass="bar"
    called="00-11-22-33-44-55:localhost"
    calling="00:11:22:33:44:55"
    request="User-Name=$user,User-Password=$pass,Called-Station-ID=$called,Calling-Station-ID=$calling"
    echo $request | radclient localhost auth testing123

Testing accounting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can do this with ``radclient``, but first of all you will have to
create a text file like the following one:

.. code-block:: text

    # /tmp/accounting.txt

    Acct-Session-Id = "35000006"
    User-Name = "jim"
    NAS-IP-Address = 172.16.64.91
    NAS-Port = 1
    NAS-Port-Type = Async
    Acct-Status-Type = Interim-Update
    Acct-Authentic = RADIUS
    Service-Type = Login-User
    Login-Service = Telnet
    Login-IP-Host = 172.16.64.25
    Acct-Delay-Time = 0
    Acct-Session-Time = 261
    Acct-Input-Octets = 9900909
    Acct-Output-Octets = 10101010101
    Called-Station-Id = 00-27-22-F3-FA-F1:hostname
    Calling-Station-Id = 5c:7d:c1:72:a7:3b

Then you can call ``radclient``:

.. code-block:: shell

    radclient -f /tmp/accounting.txt -x 127.0.0.1 acct testing123

You should get the following output:

.. code-block:: text

    Sent Accounting-Request Id 83 from 0.0.0.0:51698 to 127.0.0.1:1813 length 154
        Acct-Session-Id = "35000006"
        User-Name = "jim"
        NAS-IP-Address = 172.16.64.91
        NAS-Port = 1
        NAS-Port-Type = Async
        Acct-Status-Type = Interim-Update
        Acct-Authentic = RADIUS
        Service-Type = Login-User
        Login-Service = Telnet
        Login-IP-Host = 172.16.64.25
        Acct-Delay-Time = 0
        Acct-Session-Time = 261
        Acct-Input-Octets = 9900909
        Acct-Output-Octets = 1511075509
        Called-Station-Id = "00-27-22-F3-FA-F1:hostname"
        Calling-Station-Id = "5c:7d:c1:72:a7:3b"
    Received Accounting-Response Id 83 from 127.0.0.1:1813 to 0.0.0.0:0 length 20

Customizing your configuration
------------------------------

You can further customize your freeradius configuration and exploit the
many features of freeradius but you will need to test how your
configuration plays with *openwisp-radius*.
